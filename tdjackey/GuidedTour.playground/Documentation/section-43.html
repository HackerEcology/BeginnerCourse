  Functions are actually a special case of closures: blocks of code that can be called later. The code in a closure has access to things like variables and functions that were available in the scope where the closure was created, even if the closure is in a different scope when it is executedâ€”you saw an example of this already with nested functions. You can write a closure without a name by surrounding code with braces (<code class="code-voice">{}</code>). Use <code class="code-voice">in</code> to separate the arguments and return type from the body.
